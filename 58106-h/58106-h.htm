<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A
LETTER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Lord</span>,</p>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">TRUST</span> I can now satisfy you
that we have both been labouring under a great mistake for some
time, and that after all no ecclesiastical rule can properly be
said to have been violated by the judgment of the Privy Council
in the Gorham Case, but that it is quite right that the Crown
should have the jurisdiction in such a case which they have
actually exercised.</p>
<p>The question then is this, What is the real nature of the suit
called Duplex Querela?&nbsp; For a suit it is no doubt, (though I
had at one time thought otherwise) and one too in the
Archbishop&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; You will find from our older
authorities that the Archbishops of Canterbury in former times
used to claim the right of interfering in their comprovincial
dioceses per simplicem querelam, i.e. as I believe, of acting, so
to speak, in all cases as joint ordinary with each Bishop
throughout their province.&nbsp; This claim of jurisdiction is
specially mentioned and discussed in Gibson&rsquo;s Codex.&nbsp;
This right, however, was disputed and given up, and the
jurisdiction was ultimately confined to those cases alone in
which, after an application to the Comprovincial <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Bishop, he had
heard the Clerk and decided wrongly against him.&nbsp; This right
the injured Clerk pursued by the process called the Duplex
Querela, a process there is some reason to believe peculiar to
the province of Canterbury, and arising from the legatine
jurisdiction of that See,&mdash;as it is well known that the
Archbishops of Canterbury anciently claimed to be legati nati of
the Pope. <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; But whether this be so or not, it
is clear that either on this ground or as metropolitans, they
have always exercised this jurisdiction within their
province.&nbsp; I cannot find any instance of the Archbishop of
York doing this, which inclines me to this hypothesis of the
legatine jurisdiction.&nbsp; If this be the nature of the Duplex
Querela it is manifest that it consists really of two parts
wholly separate and distinct from each other; one, a suit in the
Archbishop&rsquo;s Court for the purpose of determining whether
the Archbishop has in the particular case, this jurisdiction: and
this depends on the question whether the Bishop has committed an
error;&mdash;and secondly, a claim by the Clerk that if the
Archbishop has jurisdiction he shall act or proceed to institute
the Clerk as upon a presentation made to himself in his own
diocese.</p>
<p>Now the suit, and of course the Appeal to the Privy Council,
is, properly speaking, confined to the first branch alone.&nbsp;
If the Archbishop decides against the Bishop, the latter then
appeals to the <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Crown to prevent the Archbishop from improperly
infringing on his Diocesan rights, and if the Crown, upon
argument before the Delegates or Privy Council, think the Bishop
right they will by their judgment overrule the Archbishop and
prohibit him thereby from proceeding.&nbsp; On the contrary, if
they think the Bishop wrong, they will leave the Archbishop to
proceed to the second branch, the consequence of his decision,
and will direct him to act at his discretion in instituting the
Clerk, if on examination he finds him fit.</p>
<p>Or suppose the Archbishop, agreeing with the Bishop, has
dismissed the Clerk&rsquo;s suit in his Court.&nbsp; The Clerk
then appeals to the Crown, and the Privy Council hear it.&nbsp;
If they think the Bishop originally wrong in his refusal, and
therefore that the Archbishop ought to have acted on his
jurisdiction, they order him to proceed so to do, and he then
proceeds, as in duty bound, to act as he would have done if the
living were in the Diocese of Canterbury.</p>
<p>The Privy Council do not order the Archbishop to institute as
a mere ministerial act; they have no jurisdiction to do that, but
they have a jurisdiction to compel him to exercise his
Archiepiscopal discretion in that case.</p>
<p>Now the very nature and course of the proceedings shows that
this is so.&nbsp; The judgment is, that &ldquo;<i>the suit be
remitted to the Archbishop that right may be
done</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This cannot mean an order to institute
<i>at all events</i>.&nbsp; The presentation itself is not <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>officially
before the Privy Council at all, and consequently they do not
judicially know of its existence.&nbsp; The meaning of the
judgment must therefore be, that if presented (and why not if fit
also?) he be instituted.&nbsp; And what does the Archbishop in
his court proceed to do upon this?&nbsp; The first process is to
summon the Bishop to bring in the presentation, which being <span
class="GutSmall">THEN</span> and not till then, before the
Archbishop, he proceeds to exercise his discretion, as to
institution, regularly.&nbsp; Now if this be not exercised by
examination of the Clerk, these absurdities would follow.&nbsp;
1st, No provision would be made for heresy or crime committed
<i>between the examination by the Bishop and the institution by
the Archbishop</i>, and yet this interval may be one of many
months or years.&nbsp; It would be obviously absurd to institute
upon an <i>antecedent</i> supposed fitness, instead of a fitness
properly ascertained <i>at the time of institution</i>.&nbsp; The
solemn words of institution, accipe curam meam et tuam, would
forbid such a conclusion.&nbsp; Besides, if the sufficiency of
the examination before the Bishop is to be the sole criterion, in
what way is an examination <i>merely frivolous</i>, <i>one which
neither shows affirmatively nor negatives heresy or unfitness to
be dealt with</i>?&nbsp; Such an examination would be indeed a
perfectly sufficient warrant for the exercise of the
Archbishop&rsquo;s jurisdiction, but would be manifestly
insufficient for his institution of the Clerk.&nbsp; Indeed it
might even open a door to fraud.&nbsp; For a Bishop knowing a man
presented <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>to
him was a heretic or ignorant person, and being desirous to
favour him, though not willing himself to take the odium of
institution, might reject him on some frivolous or insufficient
pretence, and so deprive the Archbishop of all discretion in the
matter, and throw on him the disgrace of instituting a manifestly
insufficient clerk.</p>
<p>Again, another absurdity follows, if the law be not as above
suggested.&nbsp; There is no authority for saying, that where the
Archbishop on a presentation really to himself rejects the clerk,
the latter has any remedy by duplex querela at all.&nbsp; It
seems probable, therefore, that here the Archbishop&rsquo;s
decision is final; but, if the judgment of the Privy Council, be
a judgment ordering institution, it would follow that though the
judgment of the Archbishop alone was final, his judgment when
confirming that of the Bishop was not so.&nbsp; But, on the other
hand, if the judgment of the Privy Council really be only that
the Archbishop shall exercise his jurisdiction, the two cases
become parts of one uniform and harmonious system.&nbsp; It is
some confirmation of these views also, that in the case of a
Quare Impedit, when the fitness of a clerk is alone the question
before the court of law, which it sometimes is, it is pretty
clearly laid down that the fitness in issue before the court, is
not the fitness at the time of the refusal by the Bishop, but the
fitness at the time of the certificate of the Archbishop.&nbsp;
It is this <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>which is to decide the case.&nbsp; And this only takes
place <i>if the clerk be living</i>, which circumstance clearly
points to the conclusion that the Archbishop is to examine him
personally and de novo, that he may be enabled to make that
certificate.</p>
<p>I therefore, for all these reasons have come to the conclusion
that after all the only effect of the judgment of the Privy
Council was to send Mr. Gorham before the Archbishop of
Canterbury, in order that he might judge, after examining him at
his discretion, whether he, the Archbishop, thought him a fit
person to be instituted to the living of Brampford Speke, and in
that event only to institute him as on a presentation to
himself.&nbsp; Now, if this be so, what ecclesiastical rule is
violated by this proceeding?&nbsp; Ought not the Crown, as
governing all estates of men, ecclesiastical or civil, within the
realm, to decide on the one hand whether an Archbishop infringes
the Diocesan rights of a Bishop, or on the other hand whether he
refuses to give redress to a Clerk unjustly oppressed by the
Bishop?&nbsp; Ought not the Crown to prohibit the Archbishop from
proceeding in the one case, and to order him to act in the other;
in the latter case however, not directing him what to do when he
exercises this jurisdiction?</p>
<p>Thus, if the Chancellor dismisses a bill, and on appeal the
House of Lords differ from him, they order him to proceed, but
they do not direct him to decide in favour of the
plaintiff.&nbsp; Here the Privy <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Council order the Archbishop to
proceed; but they do not direct him to institute Mr. Gorham.</p>
<p>This is my view of the case.&nbsp; If I am right, however, I
may as well add, that the most improper person to have been
present at the argument was His Grace of Canterbury, either as
assessor or judge.&nbsp; For it was his duty to take no part till
the question of his jurisdiction was first settled.</p>
<p>Before I conclude this letter, I will add a few words on the
Royal Supremacy, a subject much talked of in these days, and
often as it seems to me by persons who do not well understand its
real import.&nbsp; Properly understood, there is nothing in it
which need give any alarm to the most sensitive Churchman.</p>
<p>The King is with us the Supreme Head of the Church.&nbsp; But
in what sense,&mdash;and what are the limits of this his
Supremacy?&nbsp; He is Supreme Head of the State also&mdash;and
the Oath of Supremacy puts both on the same footing.</p>
<p>Now to understand this properly, it will be well to divide
this Supremacy both in Church and State into its two main
branches&mdash;executive and legislative.&nbsp; Unless we do
this, we shall fall into much error.</p>
<p>But before we discuss this question, let me call your
attention to the important negative words of the Article and Oath
of Supremacy, which in fact were the main reasons for framing it,
and constitute its most important provision.&nbsp; We <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>thereby deny
all Supremacy, whether spiritual, ecclesiastical, or temporal, to
any external power.&nbsp; In this all true members of the Church
of England agree without any restriction whatever.&nbsp; I
regret, however, to be obliged to add that some of our soi-disant
members seem disposed (as extremes are always found to meet) to
attribute an absolute Supremacy to the Crown&mdash;as absolute in
fact as that claimed by the Bishop of Rome over his
subjects&mdash;and if established, as fatally leading to the
corruption of our beloved Church, as it has already done to the
corruption of the Church of Rome.&nbsp; If any one person is to
exercise absolute power in the Church of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, it matters not much whether it be
the King or the Pope.&nbsp; Indeed, if antiquity is to decide it,
the latter would have the better claim.&nbsp; But both are
contrary, as I believe, to primitive antiquity.&nbsp; Let us
proceed then to examine in detail the true executive and
legislative Supremacy of the Crown in this country.</p>
<p>The executive supremacy of the king over the Church gives him
full power, as our Article expresses it, of &ldquo;restraining
with the civil sword all wrong doers,&rdquo; but no power of
interfering in the ministrations of the Church.&nbsp; It is well
put thus by the 25th of Henry VIII., c. 21, s. 19:
&ldquo;Provided always, That this Act, nor any thing or things
therein contained, shall be hereafter interpreted or expounded,
that your Grace, your nobles and subjects, intend by the
same&rdquo; (i.e., by denying the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Pope&rsquo;s power in England),
&ldquo;to decline or vary from the congregation of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> Church in any things
concerning the very Articles of the Catholic Faith of
Christendom, or in any other things declared by Holy Scripture
and the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>, necessary for
your and their salvations, but only to make an ordinance by
policies necessary and convenient to repress vice, and for good
conservation of this realm in peace, unity, and tranquillity,
from ravin and spoil, insuing much the old ancient customs of
this realm in that behalf; not minding to seek for any relief,
succours, or remedies, for any worldly things and human laws, in
any cause of necessity, but within this realm at the hands of
your highness, your heirs and successors, kings of this realm,
which have and ought to have an imperial power and authority in
the same, and not obliged in any worldly causes to any other
superior.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are plain and true words.&nbsp; No
doubt King Henry and his successors claimed and exercised the
complete executive power and judicial superintendence of the
Church: in fact, all executive power, with one exception,
mentioned in the Article on the supremacy, and which in a lively
manner shows the limits.&nbsp; The ministry of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Word and the Sacraments is a
part of the executive duties of the Church.&nbsp; These the
Article expressly excepts, showing that even in executive matters
the king does not interfere where they are purely spiritual.</p>
<p>He claims to appoint the Bishops; but this is, I <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>conceive,
according to the truth of the law, subject to examination as to
fitness in some specific points and confirmation by the Church in
the Archbishop&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; If the Archbishop or the
guardian of the spiritualities refused this confirmation, or
refused to consecrate, or do any other ecclesiastical act,
wilfully and unjustly toward the Bishop elect or towards any
other persons entitled to have these ecclesiastical acts
performed, the king, through his chancellor, was by a commission
of delegates to examine judicially into the question of right,
and if after deciding the question against the Archbishop and
enjoining him to do the act, that prelate still refused to obey,
the king punished him for his disobedience, but did not himself
proceed to do the act.&nbsp; He then deputed the power of doing
it to two other spiritual prelates, to be specially named for the
purpose.&nbsp; This jurisdiction is even now occasionally
exercised when upon the accidental incapacity of the Archbishop a
commission is granted by the Crown to Bishops to consecrate a
Bishop elect here, or as it may be now, in the colonies.&nbsp;
For the act being spiritual, seems to have been thought ultra
vires of the king himself.&nbsp; So little did the king ever
dream of exercising personally or by lay judges what some
ill-informed people have since ascribed to him, pontifical or
spiritual power.</p>
<p>The executive ecclesiastical power, however, he did claim and
did exercise.&nbsp; But this also he did only in the same way as
he proceeds in civil <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>matters.&nbsp; He acted not
personally, but by deputed judges.&nbsp; He determines
ecclesiastical matters by ecclesiastical judges, as he does civil
matters by civil judges.&nbsp; In both it is done by the law, a
rule by which the king as well as the Church is bound.&nbsp; If
it be a case of heresy, these judges are to ascertain what the
law of the Church calls heresy and how it is to be
punished.&nbsp; If they find the law, they apply it to the
facts.&nbsp; But they do not make or pretend to alter the law:
they have no power to do this.&nbsp; If they made as well as
administered it, no man would be safe for a moment.&nbsp; To live
subject to that would be to live under a pure despotism.</p>
<p>The only ground of complaint here is, if any, that unskilful
and unlearned judges may be appointed.&nbsp; That is, if well
founded, to be cured by appointing better.&nbsp; If laymen, from
their course of reading and study or for any other reason, are
unfit to be judges, then ecclesiastics should be selected for
this purpose, as in former times they were, there being many
instances in the books of Bishops sitting as delegates on
ecclesiastical appeals.&nbsp; But the theory of the law is right,
as it stands, as to the executive supremacy of the king.</p>
<p>Next we come to his legislative supremacy, which is not
expressly touched at all by the oath of supremacy or the article
on that subject.&nbsp; But it is understood no doubt in
both.&nbsp; Here the supremacy is simply of order and rank, with
one exception only (common to both civil and ecclesiastical
supremacy), the power of <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the initiative as well as the
veto.&nbsp; No law can be discussed in convocation at all without
the initiative of the Crown first granted.&nbsp; This prerogative
exists, but is not universal, in civil matters.&nbsp; In them it
is confined to particular subjects when brought before the
parliament.&nbsp; The difference however is one of degree and not
of principle.&nbsp; Subject to this exception the king has the
very same and no greater power in convocation than in
parliament.&nbsp; He has no power of making or changing laws in
either, but he has the power in both of preventing by his veto
any change from being made.&nbsp; By his coronation oath he binds
himself expressly to observe this and all other privileges of the
Church faithfully, and it would be a clear breach of that oath to
assent in parliament to a law altering the doctrines or ritual of
the Church, unless such alteration had been previously submitted
to convocation for their assent, or the law itself made expressly
subject to their subsequent approbation.&nbsp; Both parliament
and convocation must unite as they did when the Act of Uniformity
was passed, to make according to our constitution in Church and
State such a law.</p>
<p>It is probable indeed that the discipline of the Church also
falls within the same rule, and it may be well doubted, whether
in propriety the Crown or the Bishops should ever assent to such
bills unless subject to the same assent of Convocation, and in
the late somewhat arbitrary powers given to the Bishops over
Curates, it is at least clear that it <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>would have been but just if such
powers had in some way been submitted to the judgment of the
inferior Clergy in their lower House of Convocation, before they
passed into a law.&nbsp; No doubt Parliament is unlimited in its
power of legislation, <i>but the true</i>, <i>and I trust
real</i>, <i>security that in cases like these</i>, <i>it shall
be obliged to proceed constitutionally</i>, <i>is the Coronation
Oath of the King</i>, <i>which binds in these cases his
conscience as to the exercise of his parliamentary veto</i>.</p>
<p>Here then is the real legislative Supremacy of the King over
the Church&mdash;as unobjectionable in reality, if exercised
faithfully, as any law can be.</p>
<p>But there is an evil no doubt&mdash;and the real evil is
this.&nbsp; The legislative power of the Church since Bishop
Hoadley&rsquo;s days has fallen into complete abeyance.&nbsp; I
do not stop to inquire whether there were not then good reasons
for suspending it.&nbsp; Probably there were.&nbsp; But it is a
necessary branch of our constitution, and the Crown ought to be
advised occasionally to suffer the Convocation to deliberate on
Church matters.&nbsp; There is no fear of abuse so long as the
Crown retains the initiative as to all the subjects of
debate.&nbsp; But no system of law can well stand which is not
accompanied by a power of amending from time to time those errors
to which all human institutions are liable, and which from
changes of manners and habits become in time more and more
apparent.&nbsp; A qualified employment of the Church Legislature
is essential to the healthy action <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>of the English Church.&nbsp; Let me
take the Gorham controversy as an instance.&nbsp; There was a
decision of five Judges and two Archbishops, with one Judge and
the Bishop of London dissenting, which overruled the opinion of
the Bishop of Exeter, the diocesan, and that of the Judge of the
Arches, Sir Herbert Jenner Fust.&nbsp; Surely that was a case in
which the expressions of the written law were so doubtful, that a
declaratory Act of Convocation to avoid such doubts in future,
was, to say the least of it, very desirable.&nbsp; Again, with
respect to discipline.&nbsp; Would it not be reasonable and
decent at this moment for the Crown to ask the advice of the
whole body of the Clergy as to the proper limits of Episcopal
power over themselves, and the best mode of enforcing discipline
and faithful obedience to the ritual of the Church?&nbsp; Would
not this be far better, to say the least of it, than the late
somewhat irregular proceeding of the majority of the Bishops in
giving opinions without any jurisdiction to enforce them, and
offering advice which every one is at liberty to follow or reject
at his pleasure?&nbsp; And why might not her Majesty have been
advised instead of sending a letter respecting Lord
Ashley&rsquo;s monster petition to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
to have referred that petition in a constitutional manner to
Convocation, whose decision would have been of real value,
inasmuch as it would have bound the Clergy by laying down a
proper rule for their obedience?&nbsp; And how would Parliament
be the worse for a little information <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>on such subjects from those best
acquainted with their details?&nbsp; The absence of this proper
action of the Church renders indeed the presence of the Bishops
in the Upper House, which impedes their usefulness as residents
within their respective dioceses, imperatively necessary; and I
will add, that until this is altered, the presence of the
inferior Clergy in the Lower House ought not to have been
prohibited, as it was within our own recollection.&nbsp; Perhaps
however it would be better for both if they confined themselves
to a healthy action in Convocation, and if both Houses consisted
of laymen alone, and as a substitute for Ecclesiastical Peers or
Members adopted as a standing order that no laws, relating to the
doctrine, ritual, or discipline of the Church directly, should be
passed until after or subject to the approval of
Convocation.&nbsp; In this way both Bishops and Clergy would give
to C&aelig;sar, by abstaining from political questions
altogether, the things of C&aelig;sar, and to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, by retaining in spiritual matters the
complete power of preventing all improper alterations in the
Church&mdash;the things of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp;
On the other hand, the Parliament would not abdicate its supreme
functions of legislation.</p>
<p>The laity, for it is the laity whom the Parliament (the King,
Lords, and Commons) represents, have I apprehend right to prevent
any changes in the established laws of Church in all matters
whether of doctrine, discipline, or ritual&mdash;and the sole
right of enforcing, <i>by the civil power</i>, all the
injunctions of the Church.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Even
the right of assenting to the calling Councils of the
Church&mdash;and of allowing their decrees was not taken from the
lay members of the Church, and was exercised by the supreme head
of the state in their name.&nbsp; In this country it is exercised
as to executive matters by the King, as to legislative matters by

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
